# Certifier
 
RanchiMall Certificates is a blockchain-linked verification system for all RanchiMall certificates including internship, employment, volunteership, and participation. RanchiMall has a certificate issuer FLO blockchain address **FFCpiaZi31TpbYw5q5VNk8qJMeDiTLgsrE** and an Internship Blockchain Contract FLO address **FDaX363r1ooANA9A2erhehhigNTnidq3o4**. Only these two addresses are RanchiMall-authorized blockchain addresses for certificate issuance. <br>
*(Some certificates have also been issued to RanchiMall incorporation blockchain address in the past.)* <br> <br>

## Searching for certificates: <br>
Intern or associated candidate can search their certificates by entering their name, FLO blockchain address/FLO ID, or their FLO equivalent Bitcoin address. <br>
Upon searching it provides the certificate data where the candidate can verify, download, or view on the blockchain. All certificates are published on-chain. <br> <br>

## Viewing certificates on blockchain: <br>
"View on blockchain" shows the blockchain transaction link with flodata <br>
(inside flodata the whole certificate content is written on-chain. FLO data is the feature of FLO blockchain where 1040 ASCII characters can be written in each blockchain transaction). <br> <br>


# Verifying certificates:<br>
The verification process ensures that the certificate was genuinely issued by RanchiMall. When you choose the "Verify" option, the system performs three checks: <br>
It verifies the same using these three checks: <br>
**i)** **Verification of Sender Address:** The system validates if the sender's blockchain address is RanchiMall's authorized certificate issuance address FFCpiaZi31TpbYw5q5VNk8qJMeDiTLgsrE. <br>
**ii)** **Verification of Receiver Address:** The system verifies if the receiver's blockchain address is also RanchiMall's authorized certificate receiving address FDaX363r1ooANA9A2erhehhigNTnidq3o4. <br>
**iii)** **Certificate Type Validation:** The system confirms if the certificate corresponds to one of the following categories: Internship, Employment, Volunteership, or Participation. <br>
If the certificate passes all three checks, you will be redirected to the RanchiMall website, where a verification message will confirm that RanchiMall indeed verifies the certificate. <br>

**Downloading certificates:** <br>
*All certificates can be downloaded in pdf format with the "download icon" on the certificate. It is attached with a QR code that verifies RanchiMall issued the certificate on the blockchain.*
